# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

// ======================= Frontend Tasks =======================
//
// Overall requirements:
// - Build role-based frontend (User / Organizer / Admin)
// - Implement navigation and page routing
// - Create clean and consistent UI with CSS
// - Connect to backend APIs once available (replace mock data)
//
// ----------------------- User Side -----------------------
// Tasks:
// - Home page: display list of events
// - Event details page: show event info + default image if none
// - Registration page: allow students to register
// - User dashboard: show registered events, cancel registration
//
// Completed:
// - EventDetails page with mock data + fallback image
// - UserDashboard with registered events, cancel + view buttons
// - Registration page (basic mock-up)
//
// ----------------------- Organizer Side -----------------------
// Tasks:
// - Organizer dashboard: show organizerâ€™s own events
// - Create new event page: form for event creation
// - Buttons for Edit / Delete events
//
// Completed:
// - OrganizerDashboard with mock events
// - CreateEvent page (form fully working on frontend, redirects after submit)
//
// ----------------------- Admin Side -----------------------
// Tasks:
// - Admin dashboard: show events and users (limit 5 each)
// - View all events/users pages
// - Event detail page (for admin view)
// - User management: change role, delete user
// - Event management: edit, delete
//
// Completed:
// - AdminDashboard with events + users preview
// - AdminEventsPage + AdminEventDetails
// - AdminUsersPage
//
// ----------------------- UI / CSS -----------------------
// Tasks:
// - Consistent navbar per role (User=blue, Organizer=orange, Admin=green)
// - Card layout for events and users
// - Buttons styled for primary / danger / create actions
//
// Completed:
// - CSS base styles done (forms, dashboards, cards, buttons)
//
// ----------------------- Pending -----------------------
// 1. Login & Registration page title color issue
// - Currently displayed as orange (inherited from Organizer CSS)
// - Should be blue
// 2. User registration form needs extra fields
// - Add "First Name" and "Last Name"
// - Currently only has name/email/studentId/password
// 3. Replace mock data with real data
// - All events/users/registrations are hardcoded mock data
// - Should be replaced with API calls (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE)
// 4. Delete / Edit buttons not functional
// - Currently, all delete and edit buttons do nothing
// - Need to add proper edit pages and delete logic (API integration)
